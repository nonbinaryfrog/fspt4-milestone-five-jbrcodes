# Full Stack Development Test - Week Five

This assessment tests your understanding of building a full stack app using React, Node/Express, and MySQL.

## Setup

### Dependencies

- Run `npm install` in project directory. This will install server-related dependencies such as `express`.
- `cd client` and run `npm install`. This will install client dependencies (React).

### Database Prep

- Access the MySQL interface in your terminal by running `mysql -u root -p`
- Create a new database called facebook: `create database facebook`
- Add a `.env` file to the project folder of this repository containing the MySQL authentication information for MySQL user. For example:

```bash
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_NAME=facebook
  DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
```

- Run `npm run migrate` in the project folder of this repository, in a new terminal window. This will create a table called 'students' in your database.

- Make sure you understand how the `students` table is constructed. In your MySQL console, you can run `use facebook;` and then `describe students;` to see the structure of the students table.

### Development

- Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000
- In another terminal, do `cd client` and run `npm start` to start the client in development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.

## Basic Requirements

Create a webpage with the following functionality:

- [ ] A list of students.
- [ ] A form to add new students. There should be fields to input the first and last names, separately.
  - After submitting the form, the new student should be added to the database and displayed on the page.
- [ ] Each student can be deleted with a delete button. After clicking on this button, student should be deleted from the database and the updated list of students shown on the page
- [ ] Style the app to make it look as polished as possible. Bootstrap is already loaded in the index.html file, so you can use it if you want to.
- [ ] (Optional/bonus) Clicking on a student should show the student's profile to the right of the students list. The info to display this profile should be obtained from a fetch request to `/students/:id`

To accomplish this, you will need to:

- [ ] Finish the routes in the API server (`/routes/students.js`).
- [ ] Finish the front end (`/client/src/`). Create as many components as you need.

## Guidelines

- Do not use any presentations from the class or any notes you have taken.
- Try to do the test **without looking at code you have previously written**. If you get stuck for more than 30min, you may look at your previous code - but make sure you let your instructor know.
- The only resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
  - [MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/database-use.html)
  - [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

Suggested Process:

1. Try and write the correct query in `mysql`.
1. Use that query to finish the endpoints in `/routes/students.js`.
1. Test your endpoints using Postman.
1. Call the endpoints from the front end.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. API Endpoints & MySQL

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I understand why this worked but I did struggle a lot in answering
  it as it was. I was using most of my notes from class in order to fully understand
  and look back on when I got confused (which was often).

### 2. Frontend

- Grade: 2
- Explanation: The POST methon on the front end doesn't quite work the way I was
  hoping it would and the delete button doesn't work at all! To be fair, I'm not
  very good at React and still get very confused on much of the concepts but I
  do feel as though I'm improving because I didn't think I'd get as far as I did.
